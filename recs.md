# ▷ *Kingston* — Faye Webster
*Music*

Autumn is probably my favorite season, and this song always finds its way back into my playlist around that time. It’s especially nice to listen to after waking in the morning, still dazed from a dream, while the air outside is crisp and the leaves are turning every shade of red and orange. I can stay warm under my blankets. Maybe I'll have a warm cup of chai...

> It's the thought of you that slightly scares me   
> But it takes my breath away   
> Forget what I was gonna say   
> The day that I met you I started dreaming   
> Now I write 'em down if I remember in the morningtime  

# ▷ *About You* — The 1975
*Music*

The opening instrumental is a beautiful chaos, all the sounds of a symphony colliding at once. It reminds me of the concerts I used to go to with my dad at the Kennedy Center in D.C. I often play this song on the subway or during walks, and when I do, my mind drifts through people, places, voices, faces. It helps pass the time.

> And there was something 'bout you that now I can't remember   
> It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender    
> And I miss you on the train, I miss you in the morning    
> I never know what to think about    
> I think about you   

And, of course, I haven’t forgotten.

*Music*

Dreams are a strange thing. You’re supposed to be at rest while you sleep, yet sometimes your mind feels more active than ever, spinning the wildest visions so vivid they can feel more real than waking life. That’s how some of my dreams are. I’ve lived through entire stories in my sleep, and a few have even left a mark on my waking world.

> I saw you in a dream   
> You came to me   
> You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision     
> There was no reason, no explanation  
> The perfect hallucination  

# ▷ *A Little Life* — Hanya Yanagihara
*Fiction Novel*

![A Little Life](recs/alittlelife.jpg)

I started reading this book in June 2024, and it took me a full year to finish all 814 pages. Looking back, I realize it was because I was savoring the story. I’ve always appreciated long books, since they let you follow a character’s entire life. There’s something beautiful about witnessing how much life shifts over time, so much that it feels as if you’ve lived multiple lifetimes within a single one. Yet even as everything changes, a few people remain with you through it all. And sometimes, that’s all you need.
