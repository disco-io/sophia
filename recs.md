# ▷ *A Little Life* — Hanya Yanagihara
*Fiction Novel*

![A Little Life](recs/alittlelife.jpg)

I started reading this book in June 2024, and it took me a full year to finish all 814 pages. Looking back, I realize it was because I was savoring the story. I’ve always appreciated long books, since they let you follow a character’s entire life. There’s something beautiful about witnessing how much life shifts over time, so much that it feels as if you’ve lived multiple lifetimes within a single one. Yet even as everything changes, a few people remain with you through it all. And sometimes, that’s all you need.

> “Life rearranges itself to compensate for your loss, sometimes wonderfully.”

*And I miss you on the train, I miss you in the morning*  
*I never know what to think about*  
*I think about you*
