# ▶ No Place Like My Room
*August 21, 2025*

Only a few days left before I move to New York. I’ll miss the room I grew up in, with its pink walls, the bay window overlooking our backyard, stuffed animals gifted by friends over the years, shelves filled with books I spent hours reading, and drawers full of trinkets and birthday cards.. Listening to *I Know the End* by Phoebe Bridgers during this time, I can’t help but feel a huge wave of gratitude for my room.
