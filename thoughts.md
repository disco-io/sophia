# ▷ Sick
*November 20, 2025*

How fortunate I am to have friends who will brave the cold to buy me medicine, or who offer to bring snacks and tea to my room when I’m sick. They’re by no means obligated to, yet they still do it out of the kindness of their hearts. I’m so grateful to be surrounded by friends who care for me like that <3


# ▷ empty nesters
*November 7, 2025*
gentle melody of chopin   
clashing with rachmaninoff’s storm  
my piano in the study, my sister’s in the den  
our music once filled every hallway  
the house alive with sound  
<br>
and when we left late august   
the house fell quiet  
the pianos gathered dust  
<br>
now only my parents’ whispers remain  
coffee at nine instead of seven  
afternoon tea bathed in sunlight  
two empty chairs, fewer pastries  
no more slamming doors  
no more footsteps on the stairs  
<br>
and when we return  
for us it’ll feel like we never left  
but for them  
they’ll remember how quiet it felt

# ▷ "I ___ you, So"
*October 19, 2025*

Since Sophia is a pretty popular name, some people call me by my nicknames: Soso, So, or Sophi. Coincidentally, so many songs use the “I ___ you so” phrasing in their lyrics. For example: *I Love You So* by The Walters; *I Miss You So* by MINOVA; "You know I love you So" from *Yellow* by Coldplay; and more...<br><br>
Whenever I hear such lyrics, they feel a little more personal, like the song is calling out to me by name. :)

# ▷ Ballroom
*October 11, 2025*

My first ballroom competition was so fun! Although I was quite the jitterbug, I had so much fun dancing on the floor and never stopped smiling (even during the tango, when I should've been more pokerfaced...) Watching the higher-level dancers was mesmerizing; they seemed to be communicating in a language I’m only beginning to understand.<br><br>
*11 is also my lucky number, and something special always seems to happen on the 11th of every month! This year alone, my birthday, graduation, first ballroom competition, college day, and more all fell on the 11th~*

# ▷ Plate
*September 8, 2025*

> I can't complain about having too much on my plate when my goal was to eat.  

Love this saying because it reminds me to appreciate the moment I’m in. Sometimes I get so caught up in working for the future that I forget to notice that I’m already living the life I once dreamed about. It’s definitely something to be grateful for, even during all the hard work and busy days. Sometimes what feels like too much on my plate is exactly what I set out to achieve in the first place!


# ▷ No Place Like My Room
*August 21, 2025*

Only a few days left before I move to New York. I’ll miss the room I grew up in, with its pink walls, the bay window overlooking our backyard, stuffed animals gifted by friends over the years, shelves filled with books I spent hours reading, and drawers full of trinkets and birthday cards.. Listening to *I Know the End* by Phoebe Bridgers during this time, I can’t help but feel a huge wave of gratitude for my room.
> Close my eyes, fantasize  
> Three clicks and I'm home  
> ( ... )  
> Romanticize a quiet life  
> There's no place like my room
