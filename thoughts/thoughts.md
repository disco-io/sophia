# ⚲ chameleon
*January 27, 2026*
at the door, i lose my skin  
paper-thin, i fold within  
a borrowed shade i settle in  
call it growth, disguise the spin  
in this new life i will begin  
to steal her colors, wear her skin  
study "how to: feminine"  
and master her discipline  
only then this game i'll win  
only then you'll let me in  

# ⚲ 𑣲₍ ᐢ. .ᐢ₎ ⊹ ࣪ ˖
*December 9, 2025*
Alice followed the white rabbit to Wonderland. Neo followed the white rabbit into the Matrix. In each of our own lives, we too have an invisible white rabbit that we choose to follow every day. And in doing so, we race down winding paths, pass bewildering landscapes, hop over obstacles, and travel through changing vistas. But how do we know we’re not chasing the wrong rabbit? We don’t know the destination it’s leading us toward, or whether we’ll be happy once we arrive. What if we realize too late, when we’re already too far down the rabbit hole?<br><br>
Everything I am today is a mosaic of the choices I’ve made. And staying committed to all of them, well, I must have had a lot of faith in the rabbit I chose to follow all those years ago. ^^ If the multiverse exists, there might even be versions of me who chased different rabbits too, and I can’t help but wonder who they became. But I can’t begin to imagine who I’d be if I hadn’t followed mine into my first computer science class, into color guard rehearsals, into that first ballroom lesson, or even all the way to New York.<br><br>
Sometimes it feels like trying something new now would mean abandoning that rabbit entirely, leaving everything familiar behind and starting again at square one. But maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing. After all, life is too precious to spend standing still. We should explore as much as we can, and it’s comforting to know there are infinite rabbit holes open wide, just waiting for us to dive in. :)

# ▷ nightvisions
*December 15, 2025*
only after candles are extinguished  
and streets outside fall quiet, diminished  
do my eyes reopen to the other world   
a whole universe behind eyelids unfurled  
where lovers waltz beneath my lashes  
where afterimages pass by in flashes  
where my iris drowns in consolations   
where my pupils dance beneath constellations   
one turn and eyes flutter into sight  
fragile visions spill into the light  
retreating softly before the break of day  
nothing i can do to make them stay

# ▷ one gentle proposal
*December 13, 2025*
to be unafraid of its depth  
to be unavoidant of its weight  
to be allowed into that inner world  
to take refuge into that inner world  
to observe the strange flowers that grow  
to retract the most inhospitable thorns  
to believe, patiently, in the blooms still forming  
to nurture, lovingly, even the most deformed

# ▷ clouds
*December 12, 2025*
pillows of white drifting without care  
soft edges catching sunlight and air  
when you hold back tears with strain  
the clouds grow dense with rain  
your brainstorms turn my whole world dim  
nimbus clouds veiling my sun so grim  
if i reach for them i’ll only fall through  
the clouds they’ll always keep me from you

# ▷ 嗨嗨！
*2025年12月11日*
好久没用中文了 (也忘了一点儿, 哎呀 :/ )。感觉我真的该练习用中文写写网站的文章了哈哈 ^^<br>
ok 我今天去了图书馆, 借了一些书。希望年底前还能再完成一本! 今年我读了七本书，最喜欢的是Margaret Atwood 写的 Handmaid’s Tale. 

# ▷ re-encounter
*December 4, 2025*
we've been here before  
we've met here before  
we promised to remember  
yet still forgot each time  
and once we're back the search begins  
to find the long way home  
but in the end we always do   
inevitably you :)   
<br>
your eyes a different color  
but that look always the same  
it's the only reminder needed  
before i miss it once again  
so how was i supposed to know  
to follow it, to see it through?  


# ▷ Sick
*November 20, 2025*

How fortunate I am to have friends who will brave the cold to buy me medicine, or who offer to bring snacks and tea to my room when I’m sick. They’re by no means obligated to, yet they still do it out of the kindness of their hearts. I’m so grateful to be surrounded by friends who care for me like that <3


# ▷ empty nesters
*November 7, 2025*
gentle melody of chopin   
clashing with rachmaninoff’s storm  
my piano in the study, my sister’s in the den  
our music once filled every hallway  
the house alive with sound  
<br>
and when we left late august   
the house fell quiet  
the pianos gathered dust  
<br>
now only my parents’ whispers remain  
coffee at nine instead of seven  
afternoon tea bathed in sunlight  
two empty chairs, fewer pastries  
no more slamming doors  
no more footsteps on the stairs  
<br>
and when we return  
for us it’ll feel like we never left  
but for them  
they’ll remember how quiet it felt

# ▷ "I ___ you, So"
*October 19, 2025*

Since Sophia is a pretty popular name, some people call me by my nicknames: Soso, So, or Sophi. Coincidentally, so many songs use the “I ___ you so” phrasing in their lyrics. For example: *I Love You So* by The Walters; *I Miss You So* by MINOVA; "You know I love you So" from *Yellow* by Coldplay; and more...<br><br>
Whenever I hear such lyrics, they feel a little more personal, like the song is calling out to me by name. :)

# ▷ Ballroom
*October 11, 2025*

My first ballroom competition was so fun! Although I was quite the jitterbug, I had so much fun dancing on the floor and never stopped smiling (even during the tango, when I should've been more pokerfaced...) Watching the higher-level dancers was mesmerizing; they seemed to be communicating in a language I’m only beginning to understand.<br><br>
*11 is also my lucky number, and something special always seems to happen on the 11th of every month! This year alone, my birthday, graduation, first ballroom competition, college day, and more all fell on the 11th~*

# ▷ Plate
*September 8, 2025*

> I can't complain about having too much on my plate when my goal was to eat.  

Love this saying because it reminds me to appreciate the moment I’m in. Sometimes I get so caught up in working for the future that I forget to notice that I’m already living the life I once dreamed about. It’s definitely something to be grateful for, even during all the hard work and busy days. Sometimes what feels like too much on my plate is exactly what I set out to achieve in the first place!


# ▷ No Place Like My Room
*August 21, 2025*

Only a few days left before I move to New York. I’ll miss the room I grew up in, with its pink walls, the bay window overlooking our backyard, stuffed animals gifted by friends over the years, shelves filled with books I spent hours reading, and drawers full of trinkets and birthday cards.. Listening to *I Know the End* by Phoebe Bridgers during this time, I can’t help but feel a huge wave of gratitude for my room.
> Close my eyes, fantasize  
> Three clicks and I'm home  
> ( ... )  
> Romanticize a quiet life  
> There's no place like my room
